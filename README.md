# Ticket Finder
This handy app will help you access Jira tickets quickly.

Just open the app, enter the ticket number, and this will find the page for you.

## Setup

To change your projects, press the "Edit" button on the main screen or right click the main screen and press "Settings". 

You'll be sent to a screen where you can modify your list of projects. Each project has a unique display name and a URL that it opens.

Each of your projects will appear on the main screen of the app.

## Using the app

When the app launches there should be a textbox and buttons. 

Type in the ticket number into the textbox then click the button for the project that you want to open. 
You could also press enter to let the app guess which project you want based on your recent searches.

You can right click the app to see more actions, such as settings, history, and help.

## Quick launching

I like to be able to quickly launch this app using my keyboard. This can be set up like so:

1. Create a shortcut to the executable program
2. Go into the shortcut's properties and add a Shortcut Key

If you find that there's a 3-second delay whenever you use the Shortcut key then [click this link for a way of fixing it](https://superuser.com/a/957210). 
The part which helped me most personally was the [Windows 10: unresponsive background processes](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) part.
